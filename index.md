# About

RUM Analytics Platform is an analytical tool that will provide students and universities a better understanding of how different phenomena affect students' academic performance.

# Motivation

A studentâ€™s academic performance may be affected by events outside of the university. There have been a lot of major events in Puerto Rico in the past few years, including but not limited to, hurricanes Irma and Maria, university strikes, power outages, earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These phenomena have impacted the island as a whole, but their effects on university students and universities themselves have scarcely been analyzed beyond an economic viewpoint. Our intention with this project is to provide an analytical tool that helps the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez understand how these events directly or indirectly affect its student community by analyzing data such as grades and retention rates throughout these past years. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and online teaching becomes the norm, more data such as study habits or teaching methods can be analyzed to see what aids student performance.
