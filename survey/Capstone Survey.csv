It's a great resource to have and I'm grateful for it but not many students know about it. However, I think that the university failed its student by transitioning to Outlook during a time where electronic communication is vital, especially when that transition is still isn't complete. Having important emails from teachers, guidance counselors, clubs, research opportunities, etc. being marked as spam is detrimental to the student and the college experience, and for first year students like myself we're left in the dark. It should be such a basic priority since given the circumstances it's our one line of communication. As for other aid that should be provided: extend Pass/Fail modalities for the length of this pandemic. As much as the university can claim it wants to go back to normality, online learning with a worldwide pandemic will never be normality. There should be more safety nets for students during this time. The school should embrace these. Many of my fellow students sometimes join classes while in a car because they either don't have electricity or they have to help their parents with errands and other responsibilities. I myself had to move in order to take care of my grandparents. Thankfully, I have access to an internet connection, and I find the time for my classes, but the university should not move away from Pass/Fail modalities or only provide them in limited amounts. This is a time where family responsibilities, our health, and our safety should be the number one priority. The university should stop using unfounded rhetoric saying that ""This is not a Pass/Fail campus"" when it's also a university where nearly 60% of its student receive Pell Grants and thus have economic difficulties.

During Hurricane María I got C in one class and failed another class with lab. Now during the Covid-19 I’m probably failing 3 out of my 6 classes (4 classes and 2 labs).
--The thing is not only did these events affect me, also most of the professors that I had to take class with during that time were very strict or not understanding at all. I had to dead with my flooded house, no light and scarce food during Hurricane María, the power shortages, the Covid-19 with light and internet shortages plus having to take care of a sick family member. These circumstances were already hard to take my classes, find time to study and hand in all my work; I ended either traveling a lot to find a place to be able to take classes/study or not sleep a lot of the consecutive nights. Professors doubled the work during the hurricane. Professors now during the pandemic have tripled the classes and work. 
--For example: Each of my classes this semester is supposed to be 3 hours weekly. My professors have sent me videos of classes that are 6 to 8 hours long in a week. Several of my classes have done this for most of my semester, plus I must hand in assignments of all my classes every week. So, I’m handing assignments from Monday to Saturday every week since the start of class.
--The worst part about this is that professors aren’t answering e-mails and don’t let you hand in assignments late. Also tried contacting the departments, they only sent a reminder letter to the professors. Then the professors made the assignments and classes even harder.","--As in resources, if the university could open the library and computer center even if it is limited it would help a lot. Maybe have designated open areas where students can go to connect to Wi-Fi and take classes.
--It would also help if there was a way for professors not to exceed the weekly class hours. 
A way for students to be able to contact professors better to ask questions since most professors are giving asynchronous classes and it is really hard to ask them about doubts. 
It would really be helpful if professors sent 1 or no more than 2 assignments per week. Because at some points in the semester I’ve received up to 4 different assignments from the same professor the same week."

A bit too much free time on my hands makes me kind of lazy if I'm not feeling a slight pressure, especially if academic work is reduced (which is what happened to me during the student strikes). After Hurricane María, I didn't have any power in my apartment for approximately 3 months. I had to drive to Mayagüez and other places to be able to connect to WiFi in order to study and to keep up with my duties as a TA. It was very stressful and exhausting for me and my anxiety disorder was more active than ever. I ended up dropping out of a class. For the power outages, I would drive to a place close to my apartment with power generators to charge my electronic devices and connect to WiFi. It's a useful temporary measure, but having to drive out every time the power went out was a bit draining. During the aftermath of the quakes, I was more alert since I live in an area close to the epicenters. I was ready to leave for Área Metro if a strong quake hit, even if I had set aside my research project for some time. Thankfully, I didn't have to take any drastic measures. And lastly, I wasn't able to access my lab for months because of the pandemic. This caused a huge delay for my thesis.","Consejería para la salud mental y manejo de tiempo, WiFi"
